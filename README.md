# Trivia API

## Welcome to Udacitrivia

Udacitrivia! An intense quiz game, capable of tracking user progress, adding categories and questions to the database, and creating new user profiles.
## Trivia App

The Trivia App and the Integrated API does the following:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. <br>
